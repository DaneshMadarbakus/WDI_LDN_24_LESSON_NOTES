# Solve problems like a developer

> "Computer science education cannot make anybody an expert programmer any more than studying brushes and pigment can make somebody an expert painter"
> - Eric Raymond, author of The New Hacker's Dictionary.

## Introduction

On WDI and throughout your new careers as developers, you are going to be expected to tackle problems.

This is a fun little exercise to try to tackle a problem "like a developer".

## Exercise

> Put the Sudoku up on the board, with the screen rolled up.

I'm sure everyone knows what this is. However, explaining the rules to someone else might be a little harder than you might first expect.

## Pseudo-code

The first thing we're going to have a look at is pseudo-coding.

> **Pseudocode** (rarely known as **Program Design Language**) is an informal high-level description of the operating principle of a computer program or other algorithm. It is intended for **human reading** rather than **machine reading**.

I really want everyone to get into the habit of documenting the problem BEFORE starting AND editing the problem defintion as you become more informed about how to tackle it.

### Has anyone started trying to solve the sudoku? 

I'm guessing that some people are already trying to solve the Sudoku on the board?

Coding is very addictive and you will be tempted to code before researching or planning but TRUST me - the more you plan before starting the better your solution will be. 

### Let's pseudocode the sudoku problem

- The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits 
- So that each column, row, 3×3 subgrids contains all of the digits from 1 to 9
- The same single integer may not appear twice in the same row, column, or any of the nine 3×3 subregions of the 9x9 playing board

#### Interesting fact

The number of classic 9×9 Sudoku solution grids is 6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960 (6.67×10^21). If rotation, reflection, permutation, and relabelling are taken into account, there are just 5,472,730,538 solutions.

The deduction that our brains do to solve the problem really is quite impressive!

## Commenting

Some people might try to pseudocode by commenting their code. Whilst this does help, commenting usually has a slightly different function than pseudocode. 

Commenting is usually used as a shortcut to explain how a particularly complicated section of code works. 

Some people believe that well-written code should be **self-documenting**. However, I believe when you start-off, often commenting can be used to help you re-inforce ideas until you become good enough to read the code without the comments. 

## Solve the problem

Now work with the person next to you to solve the sudoku. However, rather than trying to solve the whole problem. When you are 100% sure of a square. Raise your hand and we'll draw it in.

### Working together

You will see that if we work together, we will break down much larger problems than working on our own.

## Deliberative Practise

> The key is deliberative practice: not just doing it again and again, but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond your current ability, trying it, analyzing your performance while and after doing it, and correcting any mistakes. Then repeat. And repeat again.
