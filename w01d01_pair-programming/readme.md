## What is pair programming? - Intro (15 mins)

Pair programming is a method of programming in which two people work together at one keyboard. One person, **"the driver"**, types at the keyboard. The other person, **"the observer"** (or **"navigator"**) reviews each line of code as it is typed, checking for errors and thinking about the overall design.

### Pairing is Learning

The goal of pairing is always to learn. Whether it’s to learn about the programming language, learn about the company, learn about your coworker, learn about the project, or learn how to pair in general, you should be learning something new the whole time.

### Don’t expect just because you can program you can pair.

Like everything, to get better at pairing you will **need to practise**. People who are naturally good at programming may not be naturally good at pairing (more often than not!)

Somewhat conversely, don’t expect just because you can’t program you can’t pair either.

Pairing isn’t simply two people working on the same machine. It’s an involved process where you’re articulating code, solving problems in your head, writing code and testing it all at the same time. Even when you’re not pairing though, these are awesome skills to be good at.

### It should always be okay to ask for control.

Many developers (myself included) struggle with this and tend to want to grab the keyboard. Ask for control and if they keep taking it back, simply state - _“I’m really having trouble following all of this. Mind if I take control for 15 minutes or so? I think it’ll help me get my bearings.”_ That should be enough of an indication not only to give you control, but should help your pair realise that they’re not doing a good enough job keeping you engaged.

## How to pair program - (10 mins)

These tips come from an article called ["All I Really Need to Know about Pair Programming I Learned in Kindergarden"](http://anh.cs.luc.edu/170/Kindergarten.pdf).

### Share everything
All contributions, whether great results and errors, are “ours”, not “yours” or “mine”.

### Play fair
One person “drives” (has control of the keyboard or is recording design ideas) while the other is continuously reviewing the work and planning ahead. Stay fairly close to 50-50 on driving. Let the less experienced partner start and maybe drive a little more.

### Don’t hit your partner
But make sure your partner stays focused and on-task.

### Put things back where they belong
Put negative judgments in the trash: Be positive about you and your partner. For both, this is an opportunity to improve.

### Clean up your mess
Watch over the shoulder and you are really likely to find a large number of your errors!

### Don’t take things too seriously
If your partner picks out a bunch of errors as you type, be glad. But do not always agree. Have healthy disagreement/debate. Finding the fine balance takes adjustment.

### Say you’re sorry when you hurt somebody while moving furniture
Sit side-by-side and program, simultaneously viewing the computer screen and sharing the keyboard and mouse.  Slide the keyboard -- don't move the chairs.

### Wash your hands of skepticism before you start.
Being skeptical can be a self-fulfilling prophesy.  Buying in and “jelling” can lead to a whole that is greater than the sum of the parts.

### Flush
If you work on some parts independently either discard them (flush) and start over together or have the partner very carefully review the work with you.

### Warm cookies and cold milk are good for you
Periodically, taking a break is important for maintaining the stamina for another round of productive pair programming.

### Be aware of the power of two brains.
Experiences show that, together, a pair will come up with more than twice as many possible solutions than the two would have working alone. They will then proceed to more quickly narrow in on the “best” solution and will implement it more quickly and with better quality.

## Independent Practise
> ***Note:*** This should be done in pairs.

> Provide pairs with pieces of paper and pens.

### Task

This task is a pair-drawing exercise where one person has to have their eyes closed and the other has to tell them what to draw. This mimics what it will be like to do pair-programming effectively.

- 1 person driving (drawing with their eyes closed)
- 1 person navigating (explaining what to draw)

#### Instructions

The person navigating has to pick:

- An animal, e.g. a bird
- An object and a scenario, e.g. sitting on a hill

You have 3 minutes for the navigator to instruct the driver to draw the animal and object.

**YES**, you have to tell them what you are trying to draw!

The driver may feel that it would be easier if they just tried to draw the object on their own with their eyes shut. However, this is exactly what it will feel like when you are coding.

Have fun!

## Conclusion (5 mins)

We're going to be doing a lot of labs throughout the course, all of which I'd like to be done in pairs. Pairing is a really amazing skill that you need to practise.
